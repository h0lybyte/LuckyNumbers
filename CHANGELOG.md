# Changelog

Releases are driven by this file: the **top `## x.y.z` entry is the game version**.
Bumping it on `main` builds the Web player, uploads it to itch.io with that version,
and tags/releases `vx.y.z` on GitHub. Editing notes without changing the version does not rebuild.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-09)

- Title screen: roll three dice for a lucky number that generates your universe (star, worlds, luck), born
  in a dust-disk big bang, with a seeded nebula sky and distant galaxies
- Solar systems with believable spacing, Keplerian orbits and moons, lit by their star
- Intro cutscene in your own universe: your ship is pulled into the home planet on a spiral and crashes;
  Play carries straight on from the title camera (also when pressed mid big bang)
- Fighter ship with 22 community skins; the skin is the player's choice
- Crash site on the planet you hit: endless ground in its colours, its sun and sky, the smouldering
  wreck, boulders and loose stones
- First person: walk, run, jump; PSX arms with procedural life (breathing, stride swing, run pump,
  arms up in the air, a short tremor after the crash)
- Hands: two-bone IK on a mapped rig, finger poses as data, palms flat on surfaces you face, pick up
  (E), drop (E) and throw (click) stones; arms render on their own layer so they never clip
- UI Toolkit with the Exo 2 font; content-driven configs (proto + txtpb) with generated C#
- Smaller Web build (~11.8 MB): stripping, size-optimised IL2CPP and wasm, lean model imports

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-08)

- First Web build: WebGPU with WebGL 2 fallback, multithreaded Burst jobs (Chrome + Safari)
- Internal render resolution capped at 1280×720
- Project layout under `Assets/_Project`, dev task CLI (`tools/ln.py`), CI/CD to itch.io
